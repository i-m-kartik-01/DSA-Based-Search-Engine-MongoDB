You are given an array of
n
n
n
integers. Your task is to calculate for each window of
k
k
k
elements, from left to right, the minimum total cost of making all elements equal.
You can increase or decrease each element with cost
x
x
x
where
x
x
x
is the difference between the new and the original value. The total cost is the sum of such costs.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
n
n
and
k
