CSES - Polynomial Queries
Time limit:
1.00 s
Memory limit:

Your task is to maintain an array of
n
n
n
values and efficiently process the following types of queries:
Increase the first value in range
[
a
,
b
]
[a,b]
[
a
,
b
]
by
1
1
1
, the second value by
2
2
2
, the third value by
3
3
3
, and so on.
Calculate the sum of values in range
[
a
,
b
]
[a,b]
[
a
,
b
]
.
Input
The first input line has two integers
n
n
n
and
q
q
q
: the size of the array and the number of queries.
The next line has
n
n
n
values
t

,
…
,
t
n
t_1,t_2,\dots,t_n
t

​
: the initial contents of the array.
Finally, there are
q

q
lines describing the queries. The format of each line is either "1
a
a
a
b
b

" or "2
a
a
a
b
b

".
Output
Print the answer to each sum query.
