Your task is to maintain an array of
n
n
n
values and efficiently process the following types of queries:
Increase each value in range
[
a
,
b
]
[a,b]
[
a
,
b
]
by
x
x
x
.
Set each value in range
[
a
,
b
]
[a,b]
[
a
,
b
]
to
x
x
x
.
Calculate the sum of values in range
[
a
,
b
]
[a,b]
[
a
,
b
]
.
Input
The first input line has two integers
n
n
n
and
q
q
q
: the array size and the number of queries.
The next line has
n
n
n
values
t

n
t_1,t_2,\dots,t_n
t

n
​
: the initial contents of the array.
Finally, there are
q
