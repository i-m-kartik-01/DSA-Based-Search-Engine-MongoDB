CSES - Cyclic Array
Time limit:
1.00 s
Memory limit:
512 MB
You are given a cyclic array consisting of
n
n
n
values. Each element has two neighbors; the elements at positions
n
n
n
and
1
1
1
are also considered neighbors.
Your task is to divide the array into subarrays so that the sum of each subarray is at most
k
k
k
. What is the minimum number of subarrays?
Input
The first input line contains integers
n
n
n
and
k
k
k
.
The next line has
n

: the contents of the array.
There is always at least one division (i.e., no value in the array is larger than
k

).
Output
Print one integer: the minimum number of subarrays.

Explanation: We can create three subarrays:
[

1
]
[2,2,1]

[2,1,2]
[
