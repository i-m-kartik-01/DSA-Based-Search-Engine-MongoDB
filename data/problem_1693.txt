CSES - Teleporters Path
Time limit:
1.00 s
Memory limit:
512 MB
A game has
n
n
n
levels and
m
m
m
teleportes between them. You win the game if you move from level
1
1
1
to level
n
n
n
using every teleporter exactly once.
Can you win the game, and what is a possible way to do it?
Input
The first input line has two integers
n
n
n
and
m
m
m
: the number of levels and teleporters. The levels are numbered
1
,
2
,
…
,
n
1,2,\dots,n
1
,
2
,
…
,
n
.
Then, there are
m
m
m
lines describing the teleporters. Each line has two integers
a
a
a
and
b
b
b
: there is a teleporter from level
a
a
a
to level
b
b
b
.
You can assume that each pair
(
a
,
b
)
(a,b)
(
a
,
b
)
in the input is distinct.
