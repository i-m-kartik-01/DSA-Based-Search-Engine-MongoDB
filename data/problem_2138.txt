CSES - Reachable Nodes
Time limit:
1.00 s
Memory limit:
512 MB
A directed acyclic graph consists of
n
n
n
nodes and
m
m
m
edges. The nodes are numbered
1
,
2
,
…
,
n
1,2,\dots,n
1
,
2
,
…
,
n
.
Calculate for each node the number of nodes you can reach from that node (including the node itself).
Input
The first input line has two integers
n
n
n
and
m
m
m
: the number of nodes and edges.
Then there are
m
m
m
lines describing the edges. Each line has two distinct integers
a
a
a
and
b
b
b
: there is an edge from node
a
a
a
to node
b
b
b
.
Output
Print
n
n
n
integers: for each node the number of reachable nodes.
