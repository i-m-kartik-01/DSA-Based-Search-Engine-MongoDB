Your task is to construct a minimum-length bit string that contains all possible substrings of length
n
n
n
. For example, when
n
=
2
n=2
n
=
2
, the string 00110 is a valid solution, because its substrings of length
2
2
2
are 00, 01, 10 and 11.
Input
The only input line has an integer
n
n
n
.
Output
Print a minimum-length bit string that contains all substrings of length
n
n
n
. You can print any valid solution.
