You are given a string that consists of
n
n
n
characters between a–z. The positions of the string are indexed
1
,
2
,
…
,
n
1,2,\dots,n
1
,
2
,
…
,
n
.
Your task is to process
m
m
m
operations of the following types:
Change the character at position
k
k
k
to
x
x
x
Check if the substring from position
a
a
a
to position
b
b
b
is a palindrome
Input
The first input line has two integers
n
n
n
and
m
m
m
: the length of the string and the number of operations.
The next line has a string that consists of
n
n
n
characters.
Finally, there are
m
m
m
lines that describe the operations. Each line is of the form "1
k
k
k
x
x
x
" or "2
a
a
a
b
b
b
".
Output
For each operation 2, print YES if the substring is a palindrome and NO otherwise.
