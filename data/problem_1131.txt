You are given a tree consisting of
n
n
n
nodes.
The
diameter
of a tree is the maximum distance between two nodes. Your task is to determine the diameter of the tree.
Input
The first input line contains an integer
n
n
n
: the number of nodes. The nodes are numbered
1
,
2
,
…
,
n
1,2,\ldots,n
1
,
2
,
…
,
n
.
Then there are
n

n
−

lines describing the edges. Each line contains two integers
a
a
a
and
b
b
b
: there is an edge between nodes
a
a
a
and
b
b
b
.
Output
Print one integer: the diameter of the tree.
