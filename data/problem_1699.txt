CSES - Flight Route Requests
Time limit:
1.00 s
Memory limit:
512 MB
There are
n
n
n
cities with airports but no flight connections. You are given
m
m
m
requests which routes should be possible to travel.
Your task is to determine the minimum number of one-way flight connections which makes it possible to fulfil all requests.
Input
The first input line has two integers
n
n
n
and
m
m
m
: the number of cities and requests. The cities are numbered
1
,
2
,
…
,
n
1,2,\dots,n
1
,
2
,
…
,
n
.
After this, there are
m
m
m
lines describing the requests. Each line has two integers
a
a
a
and
b
b
b
: there has to be a route from city
a
a
a
to city
b
b
b
. Each request is unique.
Output
Print one integer: the minimum number of flight connections.
