CSES - Critical Cities
Time limit:
1.00 s
Memory limit:

There are
n
n
n
cities and
m
m
m
flight connections between them. A city is called a
critical city
if it appears on every route from a city to another city.
Your task is to find all critical cities from Syrjälä to Lehmälä.
Input
The first input line has two integers
n
n
n
and
m
m
m
: the number of cities and flights. The cities are numbered
1
,

n
1,2,\dots,n

n
. City
1

is Lehmälä.
Then, there are
m

lines describing the connections. Each line has two integers
a

and
b

. All flights are one-way.
You may assume that there is a route from Syrjälä to Lehmälä.
Output
First print an integer
