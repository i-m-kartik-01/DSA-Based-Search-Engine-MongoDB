Time limit:
1.00 s
Memory limit:
512 MB
The Hamming distance between two strings
a
a
a
and
b
b
b
of equal length is the number of positions where the strings differ.
You are given
n
n
n
bit strings, each of length
k
k
k
and your task is to calculate the minimum Hamming distance between two strings.
Input
The first input line has two integers
n
n
n
and
k
k
k
: the number of bit strings and their length.
Then there are
n
n
n
lines each consisting of one bit string of length
k
k
k
.
Output
Print the minimum Hamming distance between two strings.
