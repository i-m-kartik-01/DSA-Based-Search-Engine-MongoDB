A directed graph consists of
n
n
n
nodes and
m
m
m
edges. The edges are numbered
1
,
2
,
…
,
n
1,2,\dots,n
1
,
2
,
…
,
n
.
Your task is to answer
q

queries of the form "can you reach node
b
b
b
from node
a
a
a
?"
Input
The first input line has three integers
n
n
n
,
m
m
m
and
q
q
q
: the number of nodes, edges and queries.
Then there are
m
m
m
lines describing the edges. Each line has two distinct integers
a
a
a
and
b
b
b
: there is an edge from node
a
a
a
to node
b
b
b
.
Finally there are
q
q
q
lines describing the queries. Each line consists of two integers
a
a
a
and
b
b
b
: "can you reach node
b
b
b
from node
a
a
a
?"
Output
Print the answer for each query: either "YES" or "NO".
