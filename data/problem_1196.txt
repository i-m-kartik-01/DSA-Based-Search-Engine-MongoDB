Your task is to find the
k
k
k
shortest flight routes from Syrjälä to Metsälä. A route can visit the same city several times.
Note that there can be several routes with the same price and each of them should be considered (see the example).
Input
The first input line has three integers
n

n
,
m

is Metsälä.
After this, the input has
