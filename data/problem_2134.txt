CSES - Path Queries II
Time limit:
1.00 s
Memory limit:
512 MB
You are given a tree consisting of
n
n
n
nodes. The nodes are numbered
1
,
2
,
…
,
n
1,2,\ldots,n
1
,
2
,
…
,
n
. Each node has a value.
Your task is to process following types of queries:
change the value of node
s
s
s
to
x
x
x
find the maximum value on the path between nodes
a
a
a
and
b
b
b
.
Input
The first input line contains two integers
n
n
n
and
q
q
q
: the number of nodes and queries. The nodes are numbered
1
,
2
,
…
,
n
1,2,\ldots,n
1
,
2
,
…
,
n
.
The next line has
n
n
n
integers
v
1
,
v

,
…
,
v
n
v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_n
v
1

,
v
2
​
,
…
,
v
n
​
: the value of each node.
Then there are
n

lines describing the edges. Each line contains two integers
a
a
a
and
b
b
b
: there is an edge between nodes
a
a
a
and
b
b
b
.
Finally, there are
q

Output
Print the answer to each query of type 2.
