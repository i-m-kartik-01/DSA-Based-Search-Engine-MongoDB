You are given an undirected graph that has
n
n
n
nodes and
m
m
m
edges.
We consider subgraphs that have all nodes of the original graph and some of its edges. A subgraph is called
Eulerian
if each node has even degree.
Your task is to count the number of Eulerian subgraphs modulo

Input
The first input line has two integers
n
n
n
and
m
m
m
: the number of nodes and edges. The nodes are numbered
1
,
2
,
…
,
n
1,2,\dots,n
1
,
2

n
.
After this, there are
m
m
m
lines that describe the edges. Each line has two integers
a
a
a
and
b
b
b
: there is an edge between nodes
a
a
a
and
b
b
b
. There is at most one edge between two nodes, and each edge connects two distinct nodes.
Output
Print the number of Eulerian subgraphs modulo

2 3
Output:
2
Explanation: You can either keep or remove all edges, so there are two possible Eulerian subgraphs.
