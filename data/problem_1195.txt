Your task is to find a minimum-price flight route from Syrjälä to Metsälä. You have one discount coupon, using which you can halve the price of any single flight during the route. However, you can only use the coupon once.
When you use the discount coupon for a flight whose price is
x
x
x
, its price becomes
⌊
x
/
2
⌋
\lfloor x/2 \rfloor
⌊
x
/2
⌋
(it is rounded down to an integer).
Input
The first input line has two integers
n

and
m

: the number of cities and flight connections. The cities are numbered

is Metsälä.
After this there are
