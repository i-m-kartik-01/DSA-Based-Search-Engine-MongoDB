Time limit:
1.00 s
Memory limit:
512 MB
Given a tree of
n
n
n
nodes, your task is to count the number of distinct paths that consist of exactly
k
k
k
edges.
Input
The first input line contains two integers
n
n
n
and
k
k
k
: the number of nodes and the path length. The nodes are numbered
1
,
2
,
…
,
n
1,2,\ldots,n
1
,
2
,
…
,
n
.
Then there are
n

n
−
1
lines describing the edges. Each line contains two integers
a
a
a
and
b
b
b
: there is an edge between nodes

and
b

b
.
Output
Print one integer: the number of paths.
