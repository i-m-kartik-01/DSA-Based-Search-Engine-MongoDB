CSES - Filling Trominos
Time limit:

Your task is to fill an
n

m
n \times m
n
×
m
grid using L-trominos (three squares that have an L-shape). For example, here is one way to fill a
4

4 \times 6
4
×
6
grid:
Input
The first input line has an integer
t
t
t
: the number of tests.
After that, there are
t
t
t
lines that describe the tests. Each line has two integers
n
n
n
and
m
m
m
.
Output
For each test, print YES if there is a solution, and NO otherwise.
If there is a solution, also print
n
n
n
lines that each contain
m

letters between A–Z. Adjacent squares must have the same letter exactly when they belong to the same tromino. You can print any valid solution.
