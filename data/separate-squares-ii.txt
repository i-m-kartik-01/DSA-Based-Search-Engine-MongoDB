You are given a 2D integer array
squares
. Each
squares[i] = [x
i
, y
i
, l
i
]
represents the coordinates of the bottom-left point and the side length of a square parallel to the x-axis.
Find the
minimum
y-coordinate value of a horizontal line such that the total area covered by squares above the line
equals
the total area covered by squares below the line.

of the actual answer will be accepted.
Note
: Squares
may
overlap. Overlapping areas should be counted
only once
in this version.
Example 1:
Input:
squares = [[0,0,1],[2,2,1]]
Output:
1.00000
Explanation:
Any horizontal line between
y = 1
and
y = 2
results in an equal split, with 1 square unit above and 1 square unit below. The minimum y-value is 1.
Example 2:
Input:
squares = [[0,0,2],[1,1,1]]
Output:
1.00000
Explanation:
Since the blue square overlaps with the red square, it will not be counted again. Thus, the line
y = 1
splits the squares into two equal parts.
Constraints:
1 <= squares.length <= 5 * 10

squares[i] = [x
i
, y
i
, l
i
]
squares[i].length == 3
0 <= x

, y
i
<= 10

The total area of all the squares will not exceed
