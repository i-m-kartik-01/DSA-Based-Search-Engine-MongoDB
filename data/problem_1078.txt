Consider an

n
×
n
grid whose top-left square is
(
1
,
1
)
(1,1)
(
1

1
)
and bottom-right square is
(
n
,
n
)
(n,n)
(

)
.
Your task is to move from the top-left square to the bottom-right square. On each step you may move one square right or down. In addition, there are
m

traps in the grid. You cannot move to a square with a trap.
What is the total number of possible paths?
Input
The first input line contains two integers
n
n
n
and
m
m
m
: the size of the grid and the number of traps.
After this, there are
m
m
m
lines describing the traps. Each such line contains two integers
y

and
x

x
: the location of a trap.
You can assume that there are no traps in the top-left and bottom-right square.
