CSES - Reversal Sorting
Time limit:
1.00 s
Memory limit:
512 MB
You have an array that contains a permutation of integers
1
,
2
,
…
,
n
1,2,\dots,n
1
,
2
,
…
,
n
. Your task is to sort the array in increasing order by reversing subarrays. You can construct any solution that has at most
n
n
n
reversals.
Input
The first input line has an integer
n
n
n
: the size of the array. The array elements are numbered
1
,
2
,
…
,
n
1,2,\dots,n
1
,
2
,
…
,
n
.
The next line has
n
n
n
integers
x
1
,
x
2
,
…
,
x
n
x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n
x
1
​
,
x

n
​
: the contents of the array.
Output
First print an integer
k
k
k
: the number of reversals.
After that, print
k
k
k
lines that describe the reversals. Each line has two integers
a
a
a
and
b
b
b
: you reverse a subarray from position
a
a
a
to position
b
b
b
.
