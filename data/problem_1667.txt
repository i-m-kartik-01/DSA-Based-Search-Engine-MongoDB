CSES - Message Route
Time limit:
1.00 s
Memory limit:

Syrjälä's network has
n
n
n
computers and
m
m
m
connections. Your task is to find out if Uolevi can send a message to Maija, and if it is possible, what is the minimum number of computers on such a route.
Input
The first input line has two integers
n
n
n
and
m
m
m
: the number of computers and connections. The computers are numbered
1
,
2
,
…

n
1,2,\dots,n
1
,
2

…
,
n
. Uolevi's computer is
1
1
1
and Maija's computer is
n
n
n
.
Then, there are
m
m
m
lines describing the connections. Each line has two integers
a
a
a
and
b
b
b
: there is a connection between those computers.
Every connection is between two different computers, and there is at most one connection between any two computers.
Output
If it is possible to send a message, first print
k
k
k
: the minimum number of computers on a valid route. After this, print an example of such a route. You can print any valid solution.
If there are no routes, print "IMPOSSIBLE".
