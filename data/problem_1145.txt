You are given an array containing
n
n
n
integers. Your task is to determine the longest increasing subsequence in the array, i.e., the longest subsequence where every element is larger than the previous one.
A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the array by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
Input
The first line contains an integer
