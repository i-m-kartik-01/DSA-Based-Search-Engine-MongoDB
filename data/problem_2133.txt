Consider an undirected graph that consists of
n
n
n
nodes and
m
m
m
edges. There are two types of events that can happen:
A new edge is created between nodes
a
a
a
and
b
b
b
.
An existing edge between nodes
a
a
a
and
b
b
b
is removed.
Your task is to report the number of components after every event.
Input
The first input line has three integers
n
n
n
,
m
m
m
and
k
k
k
: the number of nodes, edges and events.
After this there are
m
m
m
lines describing the edges. Each line has two integers
a
a
a
and
b
b
b
: there is an edge between nodes
a
a
a
and
b
b
b
. There is at most one edge between any pair of nodes.
Then there are
k
k
k
lines describing the events. Each line has the form "
t
t
t
a
a
a
b
b
b
" where
t
t
t
is 1 (create a new edge) or 2 (remove an edge). A new edge is always created between two nodes that do not already have an edge between them, and only existing edges can get removed.
