CSES - High Score
Time limit:
1.00 s
Memory limit:
512 MB
You play a game consisting of
n
n
n
rooms and
m
m
m
tunnels. Your initial score is
0
0
0
, and each tunnel increases your score by
x
x
x
where
x
x
x
may be both positive or negative. You may go through a tunnel several times.
Your task is to walk from room
1
1
1
to room
n
n
n
. What is the maximum score you can get?
Input
The first input line has two integers
n
n
n
and
m
m
m
: the number of rooms and tunnels. The rooms are numbered
1
,
2
,
…
,
n
1,2,\dots,n
1
,
2
,
…
,
n
.
Then, there are
m
m
m
lines describing the tunnels. Each line has three integers
a
a
a
,
b
b
b
and
x
x
x
: the tunnel starts at room
a
a
a
, ends at room
b
b
b
, and it increases your score by
x
x
x
. All tunnels are one-way tunnels.
You can assume that it is possible to get from room
1
1
1
to room
n
n
n
.
Output
