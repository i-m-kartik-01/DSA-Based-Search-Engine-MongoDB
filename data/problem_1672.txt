There are
n

cities and
m

roads between them. Your task is to process
q

queries where you have to determine the length of the shortest route between two given cities.
Input
The first input line has three integers
n
n
n
,
m
m
m
and
q
q
q
: the number of cities, roads, and queries.
Then, there are
m

lines describing the roads. Each line has three integers
a

and
c

and
b

whose length is
c

. All roads are two-way roads.
Finally, there are
