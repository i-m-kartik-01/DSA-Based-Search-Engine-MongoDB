Given two (not rooted) trees, your task is to find out if they are
isomorphic
, i.e., it is possible to draw them so that they look the same.
Input
The first input line has an integer
t
t
t
: the number of tests. Then, there are
t
t
t
tests described as follows:
The first line has an integer
n
n
n
: the number of nodes in both trees. The nodes are numbered
1
,
2
,
…
,
n
1,2,\dots,n
1
,
2
,
…
,
n
.
Then, there are

lines describing the edges of the second tree.
Output
For each test, print "YES", if the trees are isomorphic, and "NO" otherwise.
