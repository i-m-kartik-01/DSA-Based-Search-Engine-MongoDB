CSES - Bit Inversions
Time limit:
1.00 s
Memory limit:
512 MB
There is a bit string consisting of
n
n
n
bits. Then, there are some changes that invert one given bit. Your task is to report, after each change, the length of the longest substring whose each bit is the same.
Input
The first input line has a bit string consisting of
n
n

.
The next line contains an integer
m

m
: the number of changes.
The last line contains

Input:
001011
3
3 2 5
Output:
4 2 3
Explanation: The bit string first becomes
000011
, then
010011
, and finally
010001
.
