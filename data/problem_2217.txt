You are given an array that contains each number between
1
…
n
1 \dots n
1
…
n
exactly once. Your task is to collect the numbers from
1
1
1
to
n
n
n
in increasing order.
On each round, you go through the array from left to right and collect as many numbers as possible.
Given
m
m
m
operations that swap two numbers in the array, your task is to report the number of rounds after each operation.
Input
The first line has two integers
n
n
n
and
m
m
m
: the array size and the number of operations.
The next line has
n

: the numbers in the array.
Finally, there are
m

lines that describe the operations. Each line has two integers
a

a
and
b
b
b
: the numbers at positions

a
and
b
