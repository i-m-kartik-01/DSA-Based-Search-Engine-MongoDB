boxes.
Your task is to move the letters so that all letters "A" appear before any letter "B". On each turn you can choose any two adjacent boxes that have a letter and move the letters to the two adjacent empty boxes, preserving their order.
It can be proven that either there is a solution that consists of at most
10

turns or there are no solutions.
Input
The first line has an integer
