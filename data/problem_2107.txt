We consider a string of
n
n
n
characters, indexed
1
,
2
,
…
,
n
1,2,\dots,n
1
,
2
,
…
,
n
. Your task is to calculate all values of the following functions:
z
(
i
)
z(i)
z
(
i
)
denotes the maximum length of a substring that begins at position
i
i
i
and is a prefix of the string. In addition,
z
(
1
)
=
0
z(1)=0
z
(
1
)
=
0
.
π
(
i
)
\pi(i)
π
(
i
)
denotes the maximum length of a substring that ends at position
i
i
i
, is a prefix of the string, and whose length is at most
i
−
1
i-1
i
−
1
.
Note that the function
z
z
z
is used in the Z-algorithm, and the function
π
\pi
π
is used in the KMP algorithm.
Input
The only input line has a string of length
n
n
n
. Each character is between a–z.
Output
Print two lines: first the values of the
z
z
z
function, and then the values of the
π
\pi
π
function.
