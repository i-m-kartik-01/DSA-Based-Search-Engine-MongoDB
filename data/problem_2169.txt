CSES - Nested Ranges Count
Time limit:

Memory limit:

Given
n
n
n
ranges, your task is to count for each range how many other ranges it contains and how many other ranges contain it.
Range
[
a
,
b
]
[a,b]
[
a
,
b
]
contains range
[
c
,
d
]
[c,d]
[
c
,
d
]
if
a
≤
c
a \le c
a
≤
c
and
d
≤
b
d \le b
d
≤
b
.
Input
The first input line has an integer
n
n
n
: the number of ranges.
After this, there are
n
n
n
lines that describe the ranges. Each line has two integers
x
x
x
and
y
y
y
: the range is
[
x
,
y
]
[x,y]
[
x
,
y
]
.
You may assume that no range appears more than once in the input.
Output
First print a line that describes for each range (in the input order) how many other ranges it contains.
Then print a line that describes for each range (in the input order) how many other ranges contain it.
