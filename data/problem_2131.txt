n \times n
n
×
n
grid whose each square has some number of coins in it.
You know for each row and column how many squares you must choose from that row or column. You get all coins from every square you choose. What is the maximum number of coins you can collect and how could you choose the squares so that the given conditions are satisfied?
Input
The first input line has an integer
n

n
: the size of the grid. The rows and columns are numbered

k
: the maximum number of coins you can collect. After this print

lines describing which squares you choose (
X
means that you choose a square,
