Your task is to maintain a list of arrays which initially has a single array. You have to process the following types of queries:
Set the value
a
a
a
in array
k
k
k
to
x
x
x
.
Calculate the sum of values in range
[
a
,
b
]
[a,b]
[
a
,
b
]
in array
k
k
k
.
Create a copy of array
k
k
k
and add it to the end of the list.
Input
The first input line has two integers
n
n
n
and
q
q
q
: the array size and the number of queries.
The next line has
n

: the initial contents of the array.
Finally, there are
q

lines describing the queries. The format of each line is one of the following: "1

Output
Print the answer to each sum query.
