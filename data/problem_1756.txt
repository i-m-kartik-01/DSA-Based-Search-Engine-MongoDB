Given an undirected graph, your task is to choose a direction for each edge so that the resulting directed graph is acyclic.
Input
The first input line has two integers
n
n
n
and
m
m
m
: the number of nodes and edges. The nodes are numbered
1
,
2
,
…
,
n
1,2,\dots,n
1
,
2
,
…
,
n
.
After this, there are
m
m
m
lines describing the edges. Each line has two distinct integers
a
a
a
and
b
b
b
: there is an edge between nodes
a
a
a
and
b
b
b
.
Output
Print
