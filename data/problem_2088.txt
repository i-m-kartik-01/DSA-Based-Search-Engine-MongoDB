Given an array of
n
n
n
numbers, your task is to divide it into
n
n
n
subarrays, each of which has a single element.
On each move, you may choose any subarray and split it into two subarrays. The cost of such a move is the sum of values in the chosen subarray.
What is the minimum total cost if you act optimally?
