Consider a game where two players remove sticks from a heap. The players move alternately, and the player who removes the last stick wins the game.
A set
P
=
{
p
1
,
p
2
,
…
,
p
k
}
P=\{p_1,p_2,\ldots,p_k\}
P
=
{
p
1
​
,
p
2
​
,
…
,
p
k
​
}
determines the allowed moves. For example, if
P
=
{
1
,
3
,
4
}
P=\{1,3,4\}
P
=
{
1
,
3
,
4
}
, a player may remove
