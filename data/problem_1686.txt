A game has
n
n
n
rooms and
m
m
m
tunnels between them. Each room has a certain number of coins. What is the maximum number of coins you can collect while moving through the tunnels when you can freely choose your starting and ending room?
Input
The first input line has two integers
n
n
n
and
m
m
m
: the number of rooms and tunnels. The rooms are numbered
