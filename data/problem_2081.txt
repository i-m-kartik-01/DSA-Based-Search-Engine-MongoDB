CSES - Fixed-Length Paths II
Time limit:
1.00 s
Memory limit:
512 MB
Given a tree of
n
n
n
nodes, your task is to count the number of distinct paths that have at least
k
1
k_1
k
1
​
and at most
k
2
k_2
k
2
​
edges.
Input
The first input line contains three integers
n
n
n
,
k

k_1
k
1
​
and
k
2
k_2
k
2
​
: the number of nodes and the path lengths. The nodes are numbered
1
,
2
,
…
,
n
1,2,\ldots,n
1
,
2
,
…
,
n
.
Then there are
n
−

n-1
n
−
1
lines describing the edges. Each line contains two integers
a
a
a
and
b
b
b
: there is an edge between nodes
a

and
b
b
b
.
Output
Print one integer: the number of paths.
