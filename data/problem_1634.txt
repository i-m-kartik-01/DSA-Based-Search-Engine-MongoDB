Consider a money system consisting of
n
n
n
coins. Each coin has a positive integer value. Your task is to produce a sum of money
x
x
x
using the available coins in such a way that the number of coins is minimal.
For example, if the coins are
{
1
,
5
,
7
}
\{1,5,7\}
{
1
,
5
,
7
}
and the desired sum is
11

, an optimal solution is
5

which requires

coins.
Input
The first input line has two integers
n

and
x

: the number of coins and the desired sum of money.
The second line has
