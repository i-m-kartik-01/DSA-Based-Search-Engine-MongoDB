There are
n
n
n
cities and
m
m
m
roads between them. Kaaleppi is currently in city
a
a
a
and wants to travel to city
b
b
b
.
However, there is a problem: Kaaleppi has recently robbed a bank in city
c
c
c
and can't enter the city, because the local police would catch him. Your task is to find out if there is a route from city
a
a
a
to city
b
b
b
that does not visit city
c
c
c
.
As an additional challenge, you have to process
q
q
q
queries where
a
a
a
,
b
b
b
and
c
c
c
vary.
Input
The first input line has three integers
n
n
n
,
m
m
m
and
q
q
q
: the number of cities, roads and queries. The cities are numbered
1
,
2
,
…
,
n
1,2,\dots,n
1
,
2
,
…
,
n
.
Then, there are
m
m
m
lines describing the roads. Each line has two integers
a
a
a
and
b
b
b
: there is a road between cities
a
a
a
and
b
b
b
. Each road is bidirectional.
Finally, there are
q
q
q
lines describing the queries. Each line has three integers
a
a
a
,
b
b
b
and
c
c
c
: is there a route from city
a
a
a
to city
b
b
b
that does not visit city
c
c
c
?
You can assume that there is a route between any two cities.
Output
For each query, print "YES", if there is such a route, and "NO" otherwise.
