Consider a directed weighted graph having
n
n
n
nodes and
m
m
m
edges. Your task is to calculate the minimum path length from node
1
1
1
to node
n
n
n
with exactly
k
k
k
edges.
Input
The first input line contains three integers
n
n
n
,
m
m
m
and
k
k
k
: the number of nodes and edges, and the length of the path. The nodes are numbered
1
,
2
,
…
,
n
1,2,\dots,n
1
,
2
,
…
,
n
.
Then, there are m lines describing the edges. Each line contains three integers
a
a
a
,
b
b
b
and
c
c
c
: there is an edge from node
a
a

to node
b

.
Output
Print the minimum path length. If there are no such paths, print
