n
cities and
m
m
m
flight connections between them. Your task is to add new flights so that it will be possible to travel from any city to any other city. What is the minimum number of new flights required?
Input
The first input line has two integers
n
n
n
and
m
m
m
: the number of cities and flights. The cities are numbered
1

. All flights are one-way flights.
Output
First print an integer
k
