You are given a rooted tree consisting of
n
n
n
nodes. The nodes are numbered
1
,
2
,
…
,
n
1,2,\ldots,n
1
,
2
,
…
,
n
, and node
1
1
1
is the root. Each node has a value.
Your task is to process following types of queries:
change the value of node
s
s
s
to
x
x
x
calculate the sum of values in the subtree of node
s
s
s
Input
The first input line contains two integers
n
n
n
and
q
q
q
: the number of nodes and queries. The nodes are numbered
1
,
2
,
…
,
n
1,2,\ldots,n
1
,
2
,
…
,
n
.
The next line has
n
n
n
integers
v

,
v

v
n
v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_n
v
1
​
,
v
2
​
,
…
,
v
n
​
: the value of each node.
Then there are
n

lines describing the edges. Each line contans two integers
a
a
a
and
b
b
b
: there is an edge between nodes
a
a
a
and
b
b
b
.
Finally, there are
q

lines describing the queries. Each query is either of the form "1

".
Output
Print the answer to each query of type 2.
