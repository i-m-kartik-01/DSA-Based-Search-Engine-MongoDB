CSES - Counting Paths
Time limit:
1.00 s
Memory limit:
512 MB
You are given a tree consisting of
n
n
n
nodes, and
m
m
m
paths in the tree.
Your task is to calculate for each node the number of paths containing that node.
Input
The first input line contains integers
n
n
n
and
m
m
m
: the number of nodes and paths. The nodes are numbered
1
,
2
,
…
,
n
1,2,\ldots,n
1
,
2
,
…
,
n
.
Then there are

lines describing the edges. Each line contains two integers
a
a
a
and
b
b
b
: there is an edge between nodes
a

and
b

b
.
Finally, there are
m
