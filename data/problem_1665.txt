. Your task is to divide the coders into teams that work together.
Based on your experience, you know that teams work well when the skill levels of the coders are about the same. For this reason, the penalty for creating a team is the skill level difference between the best and the worst coder.
In how many ways can you divide the coders into teams such that the sum of the penalties is at most
