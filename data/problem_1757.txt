You want to complete
n
n
n
courses that have requirements of the form "course
a
a
a
has to be completed before course
b
b
b
".
You want to complete course
1
1
1
as soon as possible. If there are several ways to do this, you want then to complete course
2
2
2
as soon as possible, and so on.
Your task is to determine the order in which you complete the courses.
Input
The first input line has two integers
n
n
n
and
m
m
m
: the number of courses and requirements. The courses are numbered
1
,
2
,
…
,
n
1,2,\dots,n
1
,
2
,
…
,
n
.
Then, there are
m
m
m
lines describing the requirements. Each line has two integers
a
a
a
and
b
b
b
: course
a
a
a
has to be completed before course
b
b
b
.
You can assume that there is at least one valid schedule.
Output
Print one line having
n
n
n
integers: the order in which you complete the courses.
