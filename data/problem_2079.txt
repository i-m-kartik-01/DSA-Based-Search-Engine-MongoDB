CSES - Finding a Centroid
Time limit:

Memory limit:

Given a tree of
n
n
n
nodes, your task is to find a
centroid
, i.e., a node such that when it is appointed the root of the tree, each subtree has at most
⌊
n
/
2
⌋
\lfloor n/2 \rfloor
⌊
n
/2
⌋
nodes.
Input
The first input line contains an integer
n
n
n
: the number of nodes. The nodes are numbered
1
,
2
,
…
,
n
1,2,…,n
1
,
2
,
…
,
n
.
Then there are
n

lines describing the edges. Each line contains two integers
a
a
a
and
b
b
b
: there is an edge between nodes
a

a
and
b

b
.
Output
Print one integer: a centroid node. If there are several possibilities, you can choose any of them.
