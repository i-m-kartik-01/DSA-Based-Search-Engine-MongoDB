Given a set of
n
n
n
points in the two-dimensional plane, your task is to determine the convex hull of the points.
Input
The first input line has an integer
n
n
n
: the number of points.
After this, there are
n
n
n
lines that describe the points. Each line has two integers
x
x
x
and
y
y
y
: the coordinates of a point.
You may assume that each point is distinct, and the area of the hull is positive.
Output
First print an integer
k
k
k
: the number of points in the convex hull.
After this, print
k
k
k
lines that describe the points. You can print the points in any order. Print all points that lie on the convex hull.
