Memory limit:

Given an undirected graph, your task is to choose a direction for each edge so that in the resulting directed graph each node has an even outdegree. The outdegree of a node is the number of edges coming out of that node.
Input
The first input line has two integers
n
n
n
and
m
m
m
: the number of nodes and edges. The nodes are numbered
1
,
2
,
…
,
n
1,2,\dots,n
1
,
2
,
…
,
n
.
After this, there are
m
m
m
lines describing the edges. Each line has two integers
a
a
a
and
b
b
b
: there is an edge between nodes
a
a
a
and
b
b
b
.
You may assume that the graph is simple, i.e., there is at most one edge between any two nodes and every edge connects two distinct nodes.
Output
Print
m
m
m
lines describing the directions of the edges. Each line has two integers
a
a
a
and
b
b
b
: there is an edge from node
a
a
a
to node
b
b
b
. You can print any valid solution.
If there are no solutions, only print
IMPOSSIBLE
.
