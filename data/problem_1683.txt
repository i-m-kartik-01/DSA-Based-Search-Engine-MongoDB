A game has
n
n
n
planets, connected by
m
m
m
teleporters. Two planets
a
a
a
and
b
b
b
belong to the same kingdom exactly when there is a route both from
a
a
a
to
b
b
b
and from
b
b
b
to
a
a
a
. Your task is to determine for each planet its kingdom.
Input
The first input line has two integers
n
n
n
and
m
m
m
: the number of planets and teleporters. The planets are numbered
1
,
2
,
…
,
n
1,2,\dots,n
1
,
2
,
…
,
n
.
After this, there are
m
m
m
lines describing the teleporters. Each line has two integers
a
a
a
and
b
b
b
: you can travel from planet
a
a
a
to planet
b
b
b
through a teleporter.
Output
First print an integer
k

k
: the number of kingdoms. After this, print for each planet a kingdom label between
1
1
1
and
k
k
