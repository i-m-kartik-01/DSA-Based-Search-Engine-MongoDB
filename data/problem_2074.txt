Time limit:
1.00 s
Memory limit:

Given an array of
n
n
n
integers, you have to process following operations:
reverse a subarray
calculate the sum of values in a subarray
Input
The first input line has two integers
n
n
n
and
m
m
m
: the size of the array and the number of operations. The array elements are numbered
1
,
2
,
…
,
n
1,2,\dots,n
1
,
2
,
…
,
n
.
The next line as
n
n
n
integers
x
1
,
x
2
,
…

x
n
x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n
x

​
,
x
2
​
,
…
,
x
n
​
: the contents of the array.
Finally, there are
m
m
m
lines that describe the operations. Each line has three integers
t
t
t
,
a
a
a
and
b
b
b
. If
t
=
1
t=1
t
=
1
, you should reverse a subarray from
a
a
a
to
b
b
b
. If
t
=
2
t=2
t
=
2
, you should calculate the sum of values from
a
a
a
to
b
b
b
.
Output
Print the answer to each operation where
t
=
2
t=2
t
=
2
.
