There are
n
n
n
cities and
m
m
m
flight connections. Your task is to check if you can travel from any city to any other city using the available flights.
Input
The first input line has two integers
n
n
n
and
m
m
m
: the number of cities and flights. The cities are numbered
1
,
2
,
…
,
n
1,2,\dots,n
1
,
2
,
…
,
n
.
After this, there are
m
m
m
lines describing the flights. Each line has two integers
a
a
a
and
b
b
b
: there is a flight from city
a
a
a
to city
b
b
b
. All flights are one-way flights.
Output
Print "YES" if all routes are possible, and "NO" otherwise. In the latter case also print two cities
a
a
a
and
b
b
b
such that you cannot travel from city
a
a
a
to city
b
b
b
. If there are several possible solutions, you can print any of them.
